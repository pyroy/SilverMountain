# Silver Mountain v0.125
A glorious game inspired by THE classic mobile game, Gold Mountain.

jk, Silver Mountain is stupid and I will never finish it but in theory this would be a RPG where your primary source of income is mining.

why are you here?
why are you reading this?

# now that I have your unwavering attention
Here's the TODO list.

# To advance to version v0.14285714286, we need to:
- Move all imports to different folder for clearer main directory
- Make visual_core, map_core and player_character modules
- Add more environment items (current items are prefixed by env_)
- Update mining so mining isn't instant
- Update mining so mining gives a drop specified in item_db.py
- Add map warps
