# Silver Mountain v0.125
A glorious game inspired by THE classic mobile game, Gold Mountain.

In theory this would be a RPG where your primary source of income is mining.

Get rich, become glorious!

## now that I have your unwavering attention
Here's the TODO list.

# To advance to version v0.14285714286, we need to:
- Move all imports to different folder for clearer main directory
- Make visual_core, map_core and player_character modules
- Add more environment items (current items are prefixed by env_)
- Update mining so mining isn't instant
- Update mining so mining gives a drop specified in item_db.py
- Add map warps

# Changelog

## v0.1 "The I've-been-programming-for-10-years-but-somehow-my-code-is-still-f***/ing-awful update"
