# SilverMountain
Silver Mountain is stupid and I will never finish it but in theory this would be a RPG where your primary source of income is mining.

why are you here?
why are you reading this?

# now that I have your unwavering attention

Here's the TODO list.

# To advance to version 1.3, we need:

- Move all imports to different folder for clearer main directory
- Make visual_core, map_core and player_character modules
- Add more environment items (current items are prefixed by env_)
- Update mining so mining isn't instant
- Update mining so mining gives a drop specified in item_db.py
- Add map warps
